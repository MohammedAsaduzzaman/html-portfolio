<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Mohammed Asaduzzaman. I've been in the United States since I was 6 months old. 
  I've graduated in December of 2017 and is currently a Tech Support Engineer at Parkland Center for Clinical Innovation (PCCI). 
  I am currenlty a father of 2. Hopefully, a father of 3 by mid-October.</p>

<p>I love my family, tech, sports, games, and movies. I've been married since 2015. My wife is the strongest person I know. 
  We now have two little ones: 3 year old and 1 year old. They are THE MOST FUN people on this earth. 
  Every day is fun, but also a challenge. 
  I've always had an affinity for healthcare, and that is why I've always been in this field. 
  I love that I can combine my love of Tech with healthcare at PCCI. 
  It's a great place to work, innovate, and accomplish goals that are intially unimaginable. 
  I'm a diehard Cowboys and Mavericks fan. It is basically a year round hobby. 
  I'm not an avid gamer as I don't have time like that anyomre. 
  But whenever I do get any "me time" I try to play games such as Spiderman, Arkham Knight, God of War and FIFA. 
  When it comes to movies, my wife and I don't have the time to go the theatre anymore, but luckily we get most of our movies from our streaming services. 
  I watch movies and shows regularly depending on if it is actually good.</p>

<p>Crazy how fast life moves when your having fun with your family and friends. 
  I think in our world everything moves so fast, sometimes we need to slow down and really appreciate everything we have. 
  I tell my wife all the time, the thing we don't do is slow down and reflect at times. We definitely need to work on that.</p>
