<h1>The Best Movies according to Mohammed</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan's masterpiece displaying Batman and the Joker.</p>

<h3>Remember the Titans</h3>
<p>Denzel Washington's performance is breathtaking. Football can bring everyone together no matter the race.</p>

<h3>Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>Will Smith's best movie. He should've won the Oscar for his performance. This movie hits deep even more as the charecter's son is played by Will Smith's son. Amazing all around.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The movie is just simply amazing. Nolan did it again. The father-daughter relationship is the heart and soul of this movie.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie is flat out INSANE. What happened from beginning to end will leave you speechless.</p>
